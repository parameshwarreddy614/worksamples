Middleware:

A middleware is a function that acts like an interceptor which is used 
preprocess some request and make a decision whether to serve the 
actual resource or not.


A middleware function will have 3 params, request, response and next.

example:

  var logger= function(request,response,next){

  }

There are 5 types of middleware,

Application-level middleware:

This middleware will be applied at application level where all the api calls 
will go through this middleware.
Router-level middleware: Used to apply middleware at router level
Error-handling middleware : used to handle unexpected errors.
Built-in middleware
Third-party middleware
